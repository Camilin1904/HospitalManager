# HospitalManager

Hospital Manager is a program that simulates the queueing and database systems of a medical laboratory.

For the purpose of realism, a random patient from a random unit is called every minute or so, as long a the user is in the menu and not doing any operation, it will notify
the user when a patient has been taken out of a queue and what queue was it.

The final version of the code is found in master.
